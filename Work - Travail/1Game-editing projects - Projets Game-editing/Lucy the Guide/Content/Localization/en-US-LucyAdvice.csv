LegacyDialog.177,"Use your pickaxe to dig, and your axe to chop! It's pretty easy, just hold your tool and swing."
LegacyDialog.178,I recommend gathering some wood from the trees around you. Making shelter and some better weapons should be your first priority!
LegacyDialog.179,"You got enough wood, right? about 10 pieces? Why don't you make yourself a work bench? It's a bit of navigation work but I trust you can do it! And it'll make crafting more complicated things much easier."
LegacyDialog.180,"To build a good bit of shelter, grab the blocks you got right now and make a house about 12 feet tall and 20 feet wide. Don't forget to add walls, a table and a chair."
LegacyDialog.181,"If I remember correctly, slimes are pretty flammable... You could definitely make some torches by lighting up their gel on some wood."
LegacyDialog.182,"Some walls are pesky, aren't they? You can't get rid of them with your pickaxe or axe... So, next best thing, it's hammer time!"
LegacyDialog.183,"Wood is great and all, but it's not really the best out there. There's some ore underground that can help you make better tools"
LegacyDialog.184,"Well, you got ore, that's a step in the right direction! Now you can them into some bars, but this needs a furnace."
LegacyDialog.185,"20 bits of stone, 4 wood and 3 torches should do it to make a good furnace! Though it's a bit complicated by hand... That work bench you made should come in handy."
LegacyDialog.186,"Now that you got your bars, you might want to mold them into something better. But this requires an anvil. Don't wanna break your work bench..."
LegacyDialog.187,5 iron or lead bars should be enough to make an anvil. Or you could buy one from a Merchant if you have the money.
GuideHelpText.Help_1064,"When the moon goes red, the water goes all red and bloody for some reason... That also makes things inside get aggressive. I don't recommend fishing during that time."
LegacyDialog.188,"I see you're lacking a little... Life. Don't worry! Underground, there are these magical heart-shaped crystals that energise anyone who touches them! But they shatter after use, so... You might need more."
LegacyDialog.189,"Looking into magic? At your current state, I don't think you could do much. But, at night, magical stars fall from the sky. Grab 5 of them and combine them, and you'll be able to harness their magic for yourself!"
LegacyDialog.190,"The magical stars that fall from the sky are pretty and all, but do make sure to collect them! You never know when they might be useful for more than magic. But they disappear when in contact with the sun so I recommend you keep them in a chest."
GuideHelpText.Help_1063,"I've done a lot of research about the Old One's Army, but it seems {Bartender} really wants to be the one to teach you. Go ask them about it."
LegacyDialog.191,"There are more people around than just you and I, {PlayerName}, I'm sure of it. But we'll need to attract them here in some way... I wonder..."
LegacyDialog.192,"For more people to move in, they'll of course need a home. As a reminder, they need to be at least 12 feet tall and 20 feet wide. Having a table and chair, a light source and walls."
LegacyDialog.193,"As much as roommates would be fun... Or annoying. People here might not want to live in the same home as others, so make sure to make one for everyone."
LegacyDialog.194,"You can assign people's homes yourself! That'll make it their definitive home, and they'll move back there even if they leave for a bit."
GuideHelpText.Help_1065,"Not only can you assign people's homes, you can also evict them for whatever reason. Just... Be nice about it."
LegacyDialog.195,"Merchants love money. And for one to come along, you'll need money. I say... 50 silver coins should be enough."
LegacyDialog.196,"Remember those heart-shaped crystals I talked about before? If you want a nurse to move in, you should go looking for those."
LegacyDialog.197,I've watched a few movies... Maybe an arms dealer might move in if you had a gun? Pretty sure you can find one in the Jungle or from our evil biome.
LegacyDialog.198,"There are strong monsters out there. Really big ones. You might want to prep up before fighting one. On another note, I've heard of an extinct race of terrarians that nearly defeated one giant monster long ago... I wonder what became of the lone survivor?"
LegacyDialog.199,"I've heard some... Insane things going on in the dungeon. Sounds of suffering, metal clanging together, machines being made... I swear someone's in there. Maybe you should take a look?"
LegacyDialog.200,I heard you lifted the curse on that poor old one near the dungeon! Maybe they might want to move in with us? That might not be too big of a stretch...
LegacyDialog.201,"I see you got some grenades on you... Now don't go throwing them around the house, that wouldn't be funny. But do hang onto them! I heard a certain dwarf enjoys these kinds of explosives."
LegacyDialog.202,"I've seen Goblins around occasionally, and it breaks my heart knowing that they're against us... Can we really not coexist peacefully?"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1100,"From my research, there's a tribe of lizard men living deep inside the depths of the underground. Maybe one's friendly? There are also bees there... Massive bees... Makes me shiver just thinking about it."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1103,"I once met a Stylist before you came along. She was the snarky type, but an amazing friend. She went underground to explore and insisted on going alone despite my warnings. She never came back... I hope she's okay..."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1104,Have you tried fishing around a little? You definitely should! Maybe you'll catch an exotic one... There may be fishermen living by the shoreline that'll pay top dollar for those! Hopefully it's not just some brat...
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1107,"There are a ton of stuff out there that you can turn into different dyes to style yourself with, but we can't exactly make those dyes yet. Hold onto the ingredients, though! They might attract someone who'll allow us to turn them into dye."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1109,"Have you ever tried to golf on sand? Yeah, terrible, would never do it again. No golfer would ever even come close to a desert due to the amount of sand! Hah! ... I swear, if you go there and prove me wrong, I'll give you 3 gold."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1110,"Artists are always finding opportunties to practice! And if we have enough people around, an artist might come along and practice their work with us! I just hope they limit their work to just the homes."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1111,"Man, there are enough people around for one big party! I'm not much of a party gal myself, but I'm sure there's someone out there who'd love to party day and night."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1112,"Since you're exploring so much, you should always look around for people in need. Whether it be underground or even on the surface! Speaking of, I heard some ethereal sounds the other night on my own rounds around the world..."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1113,"If you're feeling a little too fancy for old {Merchant}, every day, between about 5am-6pm, a Travelling Merchant might come along to sell more exotic stuff! Make sure to get something for me too, alright?"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1114,"I've done my fair share of exploring as well, and I've learned that not all monsters are hostile. Some have learned to calm down a little, and some might even sell you things during your travels."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1115,"As much as you can listen to me go on and on and on about the wonders of the world, maybe you'd like to hear more of that from someone who specialises in monsters? I see you got a beastiary, that should help get an expert."
LegacyDialog.204,"I remember seeing these teeth-filled, purple altars during my travels down below. I'm pretty sure they have some kind of slot inside that allows you to craft certain objects that powerful monsters love. Try using 6 lenses in them next time you find one?"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1159,"I remember seeing these eye-filled, red altars during my travels down below. I'm pretty sure they have some kind of slot inside that allows you to craft certain objects that powerful monsters love. Try using 6 lenses in them next time you find one?"
LegacyDialog.205,"You can make some disgusting-looking bait with that rotting skin you're collecting for some reason and some vile powder. I don't know why you'd want to make it, but you should still probably leave it in the Corruption where it belongs."
LegacyDialog.403,"I see you have a ton of... Vertebrae pieces? Why do you still have these? In any case... With some vicious powder, you can attach them into a bloody spine. I don't know why you would, though. Just leave it in the Crimson where you found the ingredients..."
LegacyDialog.206,"I've done some more research on those purple altars in the Corruption, and apparently they actually do let you craft items! Those items seem to attract big monsters, though. So make them at your own risk."
LegacyDialog.402,"I've done some more research on those red altars in the Crimson, and apparently they actually do let you craft items! Those items seem to attract big monsters, though. So make them at your own risk."
LegacyDialog.207,"Did you know that Skeletons and Piranhas of all things carry hooks? If you combine that with 3 chains using iron or lead bars, you can make a grappling hook! Grapple power!!!"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1120,"Rain is pretty annoying, I'll admit. Though I've learned that, sometimes, rain gets so gelatinous that it starts raining arguably sentient slimes! Incredibly interesting, but terrible to go through I bet."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1122,I've noticed some Goblin Scouts on the outer edges of the land. Why are they scouting in our world? What do they want? I think they might be planning invasion...
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1125,"Have you seen that, sometimes, lanterns fly up into the night sky, illuminating it? The people are celebrating your victories... And you deserve it! We're all wishing you luck out there."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1130,"You know, I think it'd be much easier to make potions if you got a bottle on that Work Bench of yours. Something to mix your potions in, right?"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1131,"Hang up those banners you keep getting from slaying monsters! Not only are they a sign of your strength, but also your experience. It'll show how you could defeat that monster easier in the future."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1132,"That snow biome... It's cold out there, isn't it? Though I've seen my fair share of interesting treasure down there I haven't found anywhere else. And, no, you can't have it."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1133,Have you ever gone exploring in the underground desert? ... Huh? You thought it was just sand down there? Of course not! But do be careful if you go explore... It's really dangerous! But it does have many unique treasures. 
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1134,"If you want some pretty stone to spruce up your buildings, I'd recommend looking for some marble underground. There are whole sub-biomes of it! But they're guarded by powerful creatures..."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1135,"There's a unique type of rock underground, it's a deep purple... And, if you find some, it may come to life and try killing you! Be careful."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1138,"If you hear a sort of shimmering sound, wait around a bit! I bet a fairy found you and will guide you to treasure. But, sometimes they get mistaken and guide you to traps or even treasure you've already found... They're doing their best!"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1136,"There's this fancy little device you can find underground called an Extractinator. If you put that useless Silt of Slush in there, you can get some unique ore that you can't find in {WorldName}! And, if you didn't know, you can put those desert fossils in there too."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1137,"It's always good to just kick back, relax and take a break from everything. Why not try fishing? Usually calms me down."
LegacyDialog.208,Dang... That pottery looks so satisfying to smash. Why don't you do it? You could find some nice supplies in them too!
LegacyDialog.209,"There's a ton of treasure lying around the world. Dunno who put it there, but they're most likely dead now. That means you can grab it for yourself!"
LegacyDialog.210,"You can find weird purple-glowing Shadow Orbs in the Corruption. They give some nice treasure, but make sure not to smash more than two... You might anger a giant monster living there. But, I read somewhere that, if you defeat it at least once... Meteors will fall from the sky?! Huh???"
LegacyDialog.331,"You can find weird red-glowing Crimson Hearts in the... Crimson, yeah. They give some nice treasure, but make sure not to smash more than two... You might anger a giant monster living there. But, I read somewhere that, if you defeat it at least once... Meteors will fall from the sky?! Huh???"
LegacyDialog.211,"No offense, but you seem a little... Weak. Why not go back underground and find some more Life Crystals?"
LegacyDialog.212,"Ah... You're asking if your armor is good enough at this point? To be honest, no. Not at all. You should probably craft yourself better armor."
LegacyDialog.213,"I think it's about time! According to my research, you're ready for your first major battle. Gather 6 lenses at a Demon Altar and take that boss down!"

LegacyDialog.214,I see you've beaten your first big challenge! Though you're gonna need to recover quick for the next one. Go get yourself a few more Heart Crystals. A total of 15 hearts should do you wonders.
LegacyDialog.215,"You know that stupid unbreakable corrupt stone out there in the Corruption? I'm pretty sure our Dryad has some Purification Powder to get rid of it. Or you could blow it all up. Do whatever, as long as it gets rid of it."
LegacyDialog.216,Remember when I told you to not break more than two Shadow Orbs in the Corruption's chasms? Ignore that. I think you're ready for that big monster. Show it what you got!
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1140,Remember when I told you to not break more than two Crimson Hearts in the Crimson's caves? Ignore that. I think you're ready for that big monster. Show it what you got!

LegacyDialog.217,"I'm not sure if you've found it or not, but there's an old dungeon somewhere in our world... Usually opposite to the Jungle. I remember there being an lonely old man there. Why don't you go check up on him? I hope he's okay..."
LegacyDialog.218,"Now that you're all ready, you should probably get the maximum energy you can get. Gather some more Crystal Hearts and use them 'till you get sick! ... Actually maybe not until you get sick."
LegacyDialog.219,"Woah... You seem way more strong and confident than you were before. Look at you! But, in any case, now that you're most likely ready to face the dangers there, why not head to the Jungle? I've read somewhere that it's got amazing loot."
LegacyDialog.220,"Now that you've done nearly all there is to do... Maybe you could dig down? Now, call me crazy, but I remember reading somewhere that an underworld exists and it has an incredibly strong material named ""hellstone"". Though it is incredibly hot to the touch. You should explore that as soon as you can!"
LegacyDialog.221,"I remember reading about a massive creature living in the underworld, as if it was it's keeper. The instructions to summon it were to make a living sacrifice while down there... Who... Who will you sacrifice, {PlayerName}...?"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1142,"You know, I heard obidian is incredibly resistant to heat... Maybe you could collect some? To make it, all you gotta do is combine water and lava. Dangerous, but effective!"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1143,"Ah... Have you ever tasted the honey of {WorldName}? No? It's absolutely divine I tell you! But the process of getting it is really dangerous... You'll have to find massive beehives in the Jungle to get your hands on that sweet, succulent honey... My mouth is watering just thinking about it..."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1160,"Look, I'll be real with you, I have no clue what creature is making those terrifying roars out in the tundra at midnight while it storms. I wouldn't go there at that time if I were you."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1144,"Oh dang, are those desert fossils you have on you?! Put 'em in our Extractinator! You can definitely extract some cool stuff from it like that!"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1145,"Wow, we've progressed a lot haven't we? So much so it seems our furnace is getting a wee bit outdated... I heard there are these ""Hellforges"" down in the Underworld, maybe you could yoink one from down there to make that hellstone in bars?"
LegacyDialog.222,"Those Demon Altars... Well, they're not dangerous or anything, but they are pretty useless now. Why don't you use that new hammer you got to smash them? I heard that smashing them yields some interesting results."
LegacyDialog.401,"Those Crimson Altars... Well, they're not dangerous or anything, but they are pretty useless now. Why don't you use that new hammer you got to smash them? I heard that smashing them yields some interesting results."
LegacyDialog.223,"Now that there are more monsters underground in those... Unique light and dark biomes, I read somewhere that even their very souls are affected. And they can persist after death! Why not collect some? Could be useful."
LegacyDialog.203,I heard there was a powerful wizard who lives in these parts.  Make sure to keep an eye out for him next time you go underground.
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1101,"I've noticed that you unleashed some... Unique mechanical forces. I remember there being someone who's well-versed in mechanics, maybe if you defeat one of those foes, you could attract them to town?"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1102,"Machines aren't so bad. Maybe we can build one of our own, if we can just get some explosive weaponry from the jungle..."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1105,"I've decided to explore the Underworld after your venture through it and I noticed, what I thought, was a familiar face. But, no, it tried attacking me! If only I had purification powder..."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1106,Who knew that pirates were interested in our land? I heard there were some sightings at the sea from {Angler}. Maybe we could ask them where treasure could be if we befriended one?
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1108,"I've always been curious about that Glowing Mushroom biome underground. It seems like there's genuine life growing down there... Like monsters! But never anything friendly. I wonder if, it was on the surface, we could have friendly life growing there..."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1123,"While I was exploring the ocean the other day, I found a treasure map floating around! I was about to grab it, but a shark got to it first and ate it... What did it even want with that map?! Could you please get it back? There may be more... And don't worry, you can keep them!"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1146,"Have you seen those beautiful Wyverns up in the sky? They're so graceful flying around... If only I could fly like that, it would make my research so much easier!"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1147,"Okay, now it looks like the Hellforge is out of date... That's a bit of an issue, isn't it? Not to worry! I read that you can combine that Hellforge with some adamantite ore to upgrade it!"

GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1149,"Seen some golden, heart-shaped fruit in the jungle recently? I ate one the other day and I felt completely invigorated! You should definitely try some."
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1150,"You know, the Jungle's become an incredibly dangerous place since you beat the fleshy wall... And now that you've beaten those mechs, there are some purple bulbs growing down there! I'm a bit suspicious of them, be careful down there!"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1151,"Oh, you beat that giant plant monster? NICE!!! And I see you got a key. Just eyeballing it here, I think it might be a key to an underground Temple in the jungle... You know where that is, right?"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1152,"I've read one time that there's a sealed Temple deep in the jungle with a locked door, unable to be pried open... Though there's a key to open that. You have it, right?"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1153,Oh my! I see you have a really special key on you! That should be able to unlock some of those unique chests down in the Dungeon. I wonder what could be in those...
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1124,"Last night, I went out stargazing... And I swear I saw some red and green flashing lights up there, not the usual color of stars. There's something up there. And since I'm pretty you're able to go investigate there, could you check it out?"
GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1154,"I remember reading about a huge fish and pig hybrid hiding away in the ocean. I've tried fishing it up, but no bait of mine seemed to interest it...

GuideHelpTextSpecific.Help_1158,"What are these- Pillars?! {PlayerName}, what did you do??? The cultists?! Uh, uhhh...... Wait, I think I know what's going on! You should- You should start clearing out the monsters around the Pillars to weaken the shields! You can do it!"
